This project aims to design and implement a Secure Phishing Detection System that not only classifies URLs as phishing or legitimate using machine learning (ML), but also ensures that the communication and results are protected using cryptographic techniques. Specifically, the system will integrate hybrid encryption (RSA + AES) for confidentiality and HMAC-SHA256 for integrity verification.
